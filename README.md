# Hey it's Kayly!

I'm a fourth year student studying pharmaceutical sciences at UBC and I'll be doing my practicum in term 2. I'm always interested in learning new things and although I don't have any experience in coding, I'm really excited to learn the practical applications in PHAR423.

I look forward to learning from you this term☀️ [Email me!](mailto:kaylyc1@gmail.com)
